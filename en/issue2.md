## KeyMesh's Token economy 

_The KeyMesh team is actively researching the KMH token economy, and what follows is a preliminary proposal._

In the KeyMesh economy, a social endorsement would be represented as a non-fungible token (ERC721) endowed with fungible KMH tokens.

 We call the non-fungible token a *trust certificate*, and the KMH tokens locked in the certificate is the *trust endowment*, which signals the strength of the social endorsement.
