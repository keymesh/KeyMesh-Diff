## KeyMesh Manifesto

KeyMesh's long-term mission is the research and development of a Crypto-Economic Social Endowment Network.

KeyMesh's vision is a decentralized network of social endowment values. The KeyMesh token economy (KMH) forms a marketplace on top of the underlying social network, so the value of social endowment may be more transparently and efficiently allocated.
